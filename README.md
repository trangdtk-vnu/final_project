# Problem

Italy’s lagging innovation performance compared to European leaders is a critical concern (Brussels, 2023).
This innovation delay can be attributed to various structural issues within the country, particularly the insuf-
ficient focus on technology-intensive specialisations and science literacy in the education system (Staff, 2021).
Science literacy, encompassing critical thinking and the practical application of scientific knowledge, is essen-
tial for students to navigate a technology-driven world. A high science literacy score is integral to a nation’s
economic development (Atta et al., 2020). In the competitive global market, advanced scientific knowledge
attracts investment, fuels technological progress, and drives economic growth (S ̧ener & Sarıdo ̆gan, 2011). Iden-
tifying factors affecting science literacy among Italian students is crucial to enhancing this score. By improving
science literacy, Italy can cultivate a skilled workforce, enhancing its competitive edge and overall prosperity.

# Data

This paper utilises the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) data, which is collected
by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and assesses the scientific knowl-
edge and skills of students across different countries. The PISA data has been used by numerous researchers,
educators, and policymakers worldwide to assess and understand the factors that influence student perfor-
mance and to make informed decisions to improve educational systems (Alatlı, 2020; Altun & Kalkan, 2021;
Erba ̧s, 2005). PISA provides critical insights into the science literacy levels of Italian students. Analysing
this data can identify the specific factors that may be contributing to Italy’s lagging innovation and science
literacy. This information can then be used to develop targeted interventions and reforms within the education
system to enhance science literacy, thereby addressing the broader issue of Italy’s innovation performance and
competitiveness on the global stage.

# Method

This paper will thoroughly examine various factors that significantly influence the science literacy scores of
Italian students by developing a robust linear regression model. Linear regression is one of the best methods
for exploring factors affecting Italian science literacy scores because it allows us to examine the relationship
between a dependent variable (science literacy scores) and multiple independent variables (factors). By using
linear regression, we can determine the strength and direction of the relationship between these variables,
and identify which factors have the most significant impact on science literacy scores. Additionally, linear
regression provides a quantitative measure of the relationship, allowing for a more precise and objective data
analysis.
